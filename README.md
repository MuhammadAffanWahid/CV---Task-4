# CV - Task 4

1- This project is to show the implementation of different kind of filters.

2- when we start the program, it asks for the input. There are ony two options if we
   enter 'image' it starts image mode and when we enter 'video' it starts video mode.

3- In the image mode following keys can be pressed:
   f  =>  averaging gray filter
   g  =>  gray filter 
   m  =>  more bright filter
   l  =>  less bright filter
   s  =>  sharp filter
   i  =>  imversion filter
   a  =>  averaging filter colored
   h  =>  horizontle edge detection
   v  =>  verticle edge detection
   k  =>  laplace filter
In some filters more about 30 seconds are taken to process the image!

 4- In the video mode following keys can be pressed:
   g  =>  gray filter 
   m  =>  more bright filter
   l  =>  less bright filter
   s  =>  sharp filter
   i  =>  imversion filter
